module: known_hosts
short_description: Add or remove a host from the C(known_hosts) file
description:
   - The M(known_hosts) module lets you add or remove a host keys from the C(known_hosts) file.
   - Starting at Ansible 2.2, multiple entries per host are allowed, but only one for each key type supported by ssh.
     This is useful if you're going to want to use the M(git) module over ssh, for example.
   - If you have a very large number of host keys to manage, you will find the M(template) module more useful.
version_added: "1.9"
options:
  name:
    aliases: [ 'host' ]

      - The host to add or remove (must match a host specified in key)

      - The SSH public host key, as a string (required if state=present, optional when state=absent, in which case all keys for the host are removed). The key must be in the right format for ssh (see sshd(1), section "SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS FILE FORMAT")
