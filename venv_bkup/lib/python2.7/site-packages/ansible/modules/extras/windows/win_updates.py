short_description: Download and install Windows updates
description:
    - Searches, downloads, and installs Windows updates synchronously by automating the Windows Update client
options:
    category_names:
        description:
        - A scalar or list of categories to install updates from
        required: false
        default: ["CriticalUpdates","SecurityUpdates","UpdateRollups"]
        choices:
        - Application
        - Connectors
        - CriticalUpdates
        - DefinitionUpdates
        - DeveloperKits
        - FeaturePacks
        - Guidance
        - SecurityUpdates
        - ServicePacks
        - Tools
        - UpdateRollups
        - Updates
    state:
        description:
        - Controls whether found updates are returned as a list or actually installed.
        - This module also supports Ansible check mode, which has the same effect as setting state=searched
        required: false
        default: installed
        choices:
        - installed
        - searched
    log_path: 
        description:
        - If set, win_updates will append update progress to the specified file. The directory must already exist.
        required: false
author: "Matt Davis (@mattdavispdx)"
notes:
- win_updates must be run by a user with membership in the local Administrators group
- win_updates will use the default update service configured for the machine (Windows Update, Microsoft Update, WSUS, etc)
- win_updates does not manage reboots, but will signal when a reboot is required with the reboot_required return value.
- win_updates can take a significant amount of time to complete (hours, in some cases). Performance depends on many factors, including OS version, number of updates, system load, and update server load.
