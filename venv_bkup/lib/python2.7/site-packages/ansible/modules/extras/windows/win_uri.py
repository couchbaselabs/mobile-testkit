short_description: Interacts with webservices.
description:
  - Interacts with HTTP and HTTPS web services and supports Digest, Basic and WSSE HTTP authentication mechanisms.
options:

    description:
      - HTTP or HTTPS URL in the form of (http|https)://host.domain:port/path
  method:
    description:
      - The HTTP Method of the request or response.
    default: GET
    choices:
      - GET
      - POST
      - PUT
      - HEAD
      - DELETE
      - OPTIONS
      - PATCH
      - TRACE
      - CONNECT
      - REFRESH
  content_type:
    description:
      - Sets the "Content-Type" header.
  body:
    description:
      - The body of the HTTP request/response to the web service.
  headers:
    description:
      - 'Key Value pairs for headers. Example "Host: www.somesite.com"'
  use_basic_parsing:
    description:
      - This module relies upon 'Invoke-WebRequest', which by default uses the Internet Explorer Engine to parse a webpage. There's an edge-case where if a user hasn't run IE before, this will fail. The only advantage to using the Internet Explorer praser is that you can traverse the DOM in a powershell script. That isn't useful for Ansible, so by default we toggle 'UseBasicParsing'. However, you can toggle that off here.
    choices:
      - True
      - False
    default: True
