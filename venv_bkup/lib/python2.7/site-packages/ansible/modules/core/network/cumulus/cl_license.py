module: cl_license
version_added: "2.1"
author: "Cumulus Networks (@CumulusNetworks)"
short_description: Install Cumulus Linux license
description:
    - Installs a Cumulus Linux license. The module reports no change of status
      when a license is installed.
      For more details go the Cumulus Linux License Documentation at
      U(http://docs.cumulusnetwork.com) and the Licensing KB Site at
      U(https://support.cumulusnetworks.com/hc/en-us/sections/200507688)
notes:
    - To activate a license for the FIRST time, the switchd service must be
      restarted. This action is disruptive. The license renewal process occurs
      via the Cumulus Networks Customer Portal -
      U(http://customers.cumulusnetworks.com).
    - A non-EULA license is REQUIRED for automation. Manually install the
      license on a test switch, using the command "cl-license -i <license_file>"
      to confirm the license is a Non-EULA license.
      See EXAMPLES, for the proper way to issue this notify action.
options:
    src:
        description:
            - The full path to the license. Can be local path or HTTP URL.
        required: true
    force:
        description:
            - Force installation of a license. Typically not needed.
              It is recommended to manually run this command via the ansible
              command. A reload of switchd is not required. Running the force
              option in a playbook will break the idempotent state machine of
              the module and cause the switchd notification to kick in all the
              time, causing a disruption.
        choices:
            - yes
            - no
