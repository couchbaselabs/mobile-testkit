module: slurp
version_added: historical
short_description: Slurps a file from remote nodes
description:
     - This module works like M(fetch). It is used for fetching a base64-
       encoded blob containing the data in a remote file.
options:
  src:
    description:
      - The file on the remote system to fetch. This I(must) be a file, not a
        directory.
    required: true
    default: null
    aliases: []
notes:
   -  This module returns an 'in memory' base64 encoded version of the file, take into account that this will require at least twice the RAM as the original file size.
