module: win_copy
version_added: "1.9.2"
short_description: Copies files to remote locations on windows hosts.
description:
     - The M(win_copy) module copies a file on the local box to remote windows locations.
options:
  src:
    description:
      - Local path to a file to copy to the remote server; can be absolute or relative.
        If path is a directory, it is copied recursively. In this case, if path ends
        with "/", only inside contents of that directory are copied to destination.
        Otherwise, if it does not end with "/", the directory itself with all contents
        is copied. This behavior is similar to Rsync.
    required: false
    default: null
    aliases: []
  dest:
    description:
      - Remote absolute path where the file should be copied to. If src is a directory,
        this must be a directory too. Use \\ for path separators.
    required: true
    default: null

EXAMPLES = '''
# Copy a single file
- win_copy: src=/srv/myfiles/foo.conf dest=c:\\TEMP\\foo.conf

# Copy the contents of files/temp_files dir into c:\temp\.  Includes any sub dirs under files/temp_files
# Note the use of unix style path in the dest.  
# This is necessary because \ is yaml escape sequence
- win_copy: src=files/temp_files/ dest=c:/temp/

# Copy the files/temp_files dir and any files or sub dirs into c:\temp
# Copies the folder because there is no trailing / on 'files/temp_files'
- win_copy: src=files/temp_files dest=c:/temp/
