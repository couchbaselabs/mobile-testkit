module: win_command
short_description: Executes a command on a remote Windows node
version_added: 2.2
description:
     - The M(win_command) module takes the command name followed by a list of space-delimited arguments.
     - The given command will be executed on all selected nodes. It will not be
       processed through the shell, so variables like C($env:HOME) and operations
       like C("<"), C(">"), C("|"), and C(";") will not work (use the M(win_shell)
       module if you need these features).
options:
  free_form:
    description:
      - the win_command module takes a free form command to run.  There is no parameter actually named 'free form'.
        See the examples!
    required: true
  creates:
    description:
      - a path or path filter pattern; when the referenced path exists on the target host, the task will be skipped.
  removes:
    description:
      - a path or path filter pattern; when the referenced path B(does not) exist on the target host, the task will be skipped.
  chdir:
    description:
      - set the specified path as the current working directory before executing a command
notes:
    -  If you want to run a command through a shell (say you are using C(<),
       C(>), C(|), etc), you actually want the M(win_shell) module instead. The
       M(win_command) module is much more secure as it's not affected by the user's
       environment.
    -  " C(creates), C(removes), and C(chdir) can be specified after the command. For instance, if you only want to run a command if a certain file does not exist, use this."

EXAMPLES = '''
# Example from Ansible Playbooks.
- win_command: whoami
  register: whoami_out

# Run the command only if the specified file does not exist.
- win_command: wbadmin -backupTarget:c:\\backup\\ creates=c:\\backup\\

# You can also use the 'args' form to provide the options. This command
# will change the working directory to c:\\somedir\\ and will only run when
# c:\\backup\\ doesn't exist.
- win_command: wbadmin -backupTarget:c:\\backup\\ creates=c:\\backup\\
  args:
    chdir: c:\\somedir\\
    creates: c:\\backup\\
