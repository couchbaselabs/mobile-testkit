module: win_shell
short_description: Execute shell commands on target hosts.
version_added: 2.2
description:
     - The M(win_shell) module takes the command name followed by a list of space-delimited arguments.
       It is similar to the M(win_command) module, but runs
       the command via a shell (defaults to PowerShell) on the target host.
options:
  free_form:
    description:
      - the win_shell module takes a free form command to run.  There is no parameter actually named 'free form'.
        See the examples!
    required: true
  creates:
    description:
      - a path or path filter pattern; when the referenced path exists on the target host, the task will be skipped.
  removes:
    description:
      - a path or path filter pattern; when the referenced path B(does not) exist on the target host, the task will be skipped.
  chdir:
    description:
      - set the specified path as the current working directory before executing a command
  executable:
    description:
      - change the shell used to execute the command (eg, C(cmd)). The target shell must accept a C(/c) parameter followed by the raw command line to be executed.
notes:
   -  If you want to run an executable securely and predictably, it may be
      better to use the M(win_command) module instead. Best practices when writing
      playbooks will follow the trend of using M(win_command) unless M(win_shell) is
      explicitly required. When running ad-hoc commands, use your best judgement.
   -  WinRM will not return from a command execution until all child processes created have exited. Thus, it is not possible to use win_shell to spawn long-running child or background processes.
      Consider creating a Windows service for managing background processes.

EXAMPLES = '''
# Execute a command in the remote shell; stdout goes to the specified
# file on the remote.
- win_shell: C:\\somescript.ps1 >> c:\\somelog.txt

# Change the working directory to somedir/ before executing the command.
- win_shell: C:\\somescript.ps1 >> c:\\somelog.txt chdir=c:\\somedir

# You can also use the 'args' form to provide the options. This command
# will change the working directory to somedir/ and will only run when
# somedir/somelog.txt doesn't exist.
- win_shell: C:\\somescript.ps1 >> c:\\somelog.txt
  args:
    chdir: c:\\somedir
    creates: c:\\somelog.txt

# Run a command under a non-Powershell interpreter (cmd in this case)
- win_shell: echo %HOMEDIR%
  args:
    executable: cmd
  register: homedir_out
