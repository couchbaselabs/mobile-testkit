module: shell
short_description: Execute commands in nodes.
description:
     - The M(shell) module takes the command name followed by a list of space-delimited arguments.
       It is almost exactly like the M(command) module but runs
       the command through a shell (C(/bin/sh)) on the remote node.
version_added: "0.2"
options:
  free_form:
    description:
      - The shell module takes a free form command to run, as a string.  There's not an actual
        option named "free form".  See the examples!

  executable:

    required: false
    default: null
    version_added: "0.9"

    description:

    required: false
    default: True
    version_added: "1.8"
notes:
   -  If you want to execute a command securely and predictably, it may be
      better to use the M(command) module instead. Best practices when writing
      playbooks will follow the trend of using M(command) unless M(shell) is
      explicitly required. When running ad-hoc commands, use your best
      judgement.
   -  To sanitize any variables passed to the shell module, you should use 
      "{{ var | quote }}" instead of just "{{ var }}" to make sure they don't include evil things like semicolons.

EXAMPLES = '''
# Execute the command in remote shell; stdout goes to the specified
# file on the remote.
- shell: somescript.sh >> somelog.txt

# Change the working directory to somedir/ before executing the command.
- shell: somescript.sh >> somelog.txt chdir=somedir/

# You can also use the 'args' form to provide the options. This command
# will change the working directory to somedir/ and will only run when
# somedir/somelog.txt doesn't exist.
- shell: somescript.sh >> somelog.txt
  args:
    chdir: somedir/
    creates: somelog.txt

# Run a command that uses non-posix shell-isms (in this example /bin/sh
# doesn't handle redirection and wildcards together but bash does)
- shell: cat < /tmp/*txt
  args:
    executable: /bin/bash
