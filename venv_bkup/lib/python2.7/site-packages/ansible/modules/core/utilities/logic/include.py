module: include
short_description: include a play or task list.
description:
     - Loads a file with a list of plays or tasks to be executed in the current playbook.
     - Files with a list of plays can only be included at the top level, lists of tasks can only be included where tasks normally run (in play).
     - Before 2.0 all includes were 'static', executed at play load time.
     - Since 2.0 task includes are dynamic and behave more like real tasks.  This means they can be looped, skipped and use variables from any source.
       Ansible tries to auto detect this, use the `static` directive (new in 2.1) to bypass autodetection.
version_added: "0.6"

    description:
        - This module allows you to specify the name of the file directly w/o any other options.
notes:
    - This is really not a module, though it appears as such, this is a feature of the Ansible Engine, as such it cannot be overridden the same way a module can.
