module: include_role
short_description: Load and execute a role
description:
     - "Loads and executes a role as a task, this frees roles from the `role:` directive and allows them to be treated more as tasks."
version_added: "2.2"
options:
  name:
    description:
      - The name of the role to be executed.
    required: True
  tasks_from:
    description:
      - "File to load from a Role's tasks/ directory."
    required: False
    default: 'main'
  vars_from:
    description:
      - "File to load from a Role's vars/ directory."
    required: False
    default: 'main'
  defaults_from:
    description:
      - "File to load from a Role's defaults/ directory."
    required: False
    default: 'main'
  allow_duplicates:
    description:
      - Overrides the role's metadata setting to allow using a role more than once with the same parameters.
    required: False
    default: True
  private:
    description:
      - If True the variables from defaults/ and vars/ in a role will not be made available to the rest of the play.
    default: None
notes:
    - THIS IS EARLY PREVIEW, THINGS MAY CHANGE
    - Handlers are made available to the whole play.
    - simple dependencies seem to work fine.
    - As with C(include) this task can be static or dynamic, If static it implies that it won't need templating nor loops nor conditionals and will show included tasks in the --list options. Ansible will try to autodetect what is needed, but you can set `static: yes|no` at task level to control this.
