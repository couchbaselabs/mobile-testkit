module: ping
version_added: historical
short_description: Try to connect to host, verify a usable python and return C(pong) on success.
description:
   - A trivial test module, this module always returns C(pong) on successful
     contact. It does not make sense in playbooks, but it is useful from
     C(/usr/bin/ansible) to verify the ability to login and that a usable python is configured.
   - This is NOT ICMP ping, this is just a trivial test module.
