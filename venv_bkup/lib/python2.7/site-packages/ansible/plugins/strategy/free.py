        The "free" strategy is a bit more complex, in that it allows tasks to
        be sent to hosts as quickly as they can be processed. This means that
        some hosts may finish very quickly if run tasks result in little or no
        work being done versus other systems.

        The algorithm used here also tries to be more "fair" when iterating
        through hosts by remembering the last host in the list to be given a task
        and starting the search from there as opposed to the top of the hosts
        list again, which would end up favoring hosts near the beginning of the
        list.
