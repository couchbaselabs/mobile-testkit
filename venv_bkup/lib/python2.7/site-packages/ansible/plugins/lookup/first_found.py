# take a list of files and (optionally) a list of paths
# return the first existing file found in the paths
# [file1, file2, file3], [path1, path2, path3]
# search order is:
# path1/file1
# path1/file2
# path1/file3
# path2/file1
# path2/file2
# path2/file3
# path3/file1
# path3/file2
# path3/file3

# first file found with os.path.exists() is returned
# no file matches raises ansibleerror
# EXAMPLES
#  - name: copy first existing file found to /some/file
#    action: copy src=$item dest=/some/file
#    with_first_found: 
#     - files: foo ${inventory_hostname} bar
#       paths: /tmp/production /tmp/staging

# that will look for files in this order:
# /tmp/production/foo
#                 ${inventory_hostname}
#                 bar
# /tmp/staging/foo
#              ${inventory_hostname}
#              bar
                  
#  - name: copy first existing file found to /some/file
#    action: copy src=$item dest=/some/file
#    with_first_found: 
#     - files: /some/place/foo ${inventory_hostname} /some/place/else

#  that will look for files in this order:
#  /some/place/foo
#  $relative_path/${inventory_hostname}
#  /some/place/else

# example - including tasks:
#  tasks:
#  - include: $item
#    with_first_found:
#     - files: generic
#       paths: tasks/staging tasks/production
# this will include the tasks in the file generic where it is found first (staging or production)

# example simple file lists
#tasks:
#- name: first found file
#  action: copy src=$item dest=/etc/file.cfg
#  with_first_found:
#  - files: foo.${inventory_hostname} foo


# example skipping if no matched files
# First_found also offers the ability to control whether or not failing
# to find a file returns an error or not
#
#- name: first found file - or skip
#  action: copy src=$item dest=/etc/file.cfg
#  with_first_found:
#  - files: foo.${inventory_hostname}
#    skip: true

# example a role with default configuration and configuration per host
# you can set multiple terms with their own files and paths to look through.
# consider a role that sets some configuration per host falling back on a default config.
#
#- name: some configuration template
#  template: src={{ item }} dest=/etc/file.cfg mode=0444 owner=root group=root
#  with_first_found:
#   - files:
#      - ${inventory_hostname}/etc/file.cfg
#     paths:
#      - ../../../templates.overwrites
#      - ../../../templates
#   - files:
#      - etc/file.cfg
#     paths:
#      - templates

# the above will return an empty list if the files cannot be found at all
# if skip is unspecificed or if it is set to false then it will return a list 
# error which can be caught bye ignore_errors: true for that action.

# finally - if you want you can use it, in place to replace first_available_file:
# you simply cannot use the - files, path or skip options. simply replace
# first_available_file with with_first_found and leave the file listing in place
#
#
#  - name: with_first_found like first_available_file
#    action: copy src=$item dest=/tmp/faftest
#    with_first_found:
#     - ../files/foo
#     - ../files/bar
#     - ../files/baz
#    ignore_errors: true
