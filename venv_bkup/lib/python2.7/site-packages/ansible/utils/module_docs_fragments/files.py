      - mode the file or directory should be. For those used to I(/usr/bin/chmod) remember that modes are actually octal numbers (like 0644). Leaving off the leading zero will likely have unexpected results. As of version 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, C(u+rwx) or C(u=rw,g=r,o=r)).

      - user part of SELinux file context. Will default to system policy, if
        applicable. If set to C(_default), it will use the C(user) portion of the
        policy if available

      - role part of SELinux file context, C(_default) feature works as for I(seuser).

    description:
      - level part of the SELinux file context. This is the MLS/MCS attribute,
        sometimes known as the C(range). C(_default) feature works as for
        I(seuser).
  unsafe_writes:
    description:
      -  Normally this module uses atomic operations to prevent data corruption or inconsistent reads from the target files,
         sometimes systems are configured or just broken in ways that prevent this. One example are docker mounted files,
         they cannot be updated atomically and can only be done in an unsafe manner.
      -  This boolean option allows ansible to fall back to unsafe methods of updating files for those cases in which you do
         not have any other choice. Be aware that this is subject to race conditions and can lead to data corruption.
