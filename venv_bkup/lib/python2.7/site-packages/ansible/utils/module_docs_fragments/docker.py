notes:
    - Connect to the Docker daemon by providing parameters with each task or by defining environment variables.
      You can define DOCKER_HOST, DOCKER_TLS_HOSTNAME, DOCKER_API_VERSION, DOCKER_CERT_PATH, DOCKER_SSL_VERSION,
      DOCKER_TLS, DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY and DOCKER_TIMEOUT. If you are using docker machine, run the script shipped
      with the product that sets up the environment. It will set these variables for you. See
      https://docker-py.readthedocs.org/en/stable/machine/ for more details.
