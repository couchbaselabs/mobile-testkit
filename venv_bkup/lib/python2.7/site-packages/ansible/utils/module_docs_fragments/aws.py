  - If parameters are not set within the module, the following
    environment variables can be used in decreasing order of precedence
    C(AWS_URL) or C(EC2_URL),
    C(AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID) or C(AWS_ACCESS_KEY) or C(EC2_ACCESS_KEY),
    C(AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) or C(AWS_SECRET_KEY) or C(EC2_SECRET_KEY),
    C(AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN) or C(EC2_SECURITY_TOKEN),
    C(AWS_REGION) or C(EC2_REGION)
  - Ansible uses the boto configuration file (typically ~/.boto) if no
    credentials are provided. See http://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html 
  - C(AWS_REGION) or C(EC2_REGION) can be typically be used to specify the 
    AWS region, when required, but this can also be configured in the boto config file
