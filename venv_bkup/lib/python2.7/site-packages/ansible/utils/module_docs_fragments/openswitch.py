  host:
    description:

        does not affect the SSH argument.
    required: true
  port:
    description:
      - Specifies the port to use when building the connection to the remote
        device.  This value applies to either I(cli) or I(rest).  The port
        value will default to the appropriate transport common port if
        none is provided in the task.  (cli=22, http=80, https=443).  Note
        this argument does not affect the SSH transport.
    required: false

  username:

        either the CLI login or the eAPI authentication depending on which
        transport is used. Note this argument does not affect the SSH
        transport. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of
        environment variable C(ANSIBLE_NET_USERNAME) will be used instead.
    required: false
  password:
    description:
      - Specifies the password to use to authenticate the connection to
        the remote device.  This is a common argument used for either I(cli)
        or I(rest) transports.  Note this argument does not affect the SSH
        transport. If the value is not specified in the task, the value of

  use_ssl:
    description:

    required: false
    default: yes
    choices: ['yes', 'no']
  provider:
    description:
      - Convenience method that allows all I(openswitch) arguments to be passed as
