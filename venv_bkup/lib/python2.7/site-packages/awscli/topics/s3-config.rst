The ``aws s3`` transfer commands, which include the ``cp``, ``sync``, ``mv``,
and ``rm`` commands, have additional configuration values you can use to
control S3 transfers.  This topic guide discusses these parameters as well as
best practices and guidelines for setting these values.

Before discussing the specifics of these values, note that these values are
entirely optional.  You should be able to use the ``aws s3`` transfer commands
without having to configure any of these values.  These configuration values
are provided in the case where you need to modify one of these values, either
for performance reasons or to account for the specific environment where these
``aws s3`` commands are being run.


Configuration Values
====================

These are the configuration values you can set for S3:

* ``max_concurrent_requests`` - The maximum number of concurrent requests.
* ``max_queue_size`` - The maximum number of tasks in the task queue.
* ``multipart_threshold`` - The size threshold the CLI uses for multipart
  transfers of individual files.
* ``multipart_chunksize`` - When using multipart transfers, this is the chunk
  size that the CLI uses for multipart transfers of individual files.

These values must be set under the top level ``s3`` key in the AWS Config File,
which has a default location of ``~/.aws/config``.  Below is an example
configuration::

    [profile development]
    aws_access_key_id=foo
    aws_secret_access_key=bar
    s3 =
      max_concurrent_requests = 20
      max_queue_size = 10000
      multipart_threshold = 64MB
      multipart_chunksize = 16MB

Note that all the S3 configuration values are indented and nested under the top
level ``s3`` key.

You can also set these values programatically using the ``aws configure set``
command.  For example, to set the above values for the default profile, you
could instead run these commands::

    $ aws configure set default.s3.max_concurrent_requests 20
    $ aws configure set default.s3.max_queue_size 10000
    $ aws configure set default.s3.multipart_threshold 64MB
    $ aws configure set default.s3.multipart_chunksize 16MB


max_concurrent_requests
-----------------------

**Default** - ``10``

The ``aws s3`` transfer commands are multithreaded.  At any given time,
multiple requests to Amazon S3 are in flight.  For example, if you are
uploading a directory via ``aws s3 cp localdir s3://bucket/ --recursive``, the
AWS CLI could be uploading the local files ``localdir/file1``,
``localdir/file2``, and ``localdir/file3`` in parallel.  The
``max_concurrent_requests`` specifies the maximum number of transfer commands
that are allowed at any given time.

You may need to change this value for a few reasons:

* Decreasing this value - On some environments, the default of 10 concurrent
  requests can overwhelm a system.  This may cause connection timeouts or
  slow the responsiveness of the system.  Lowering this value will make the
  S3 transfer commands less resource intensive.  The tradeoff is that
  S3 transfers may take longer to complete.
* Increasing this value - In some scenarios, you may want the S3 transfers
  to complete as quickly as possible, using as much network bandwidth
  as necessary.  In this scenario, the default number of concurrent requests
  may not be sufficient to utilize all the network bandwidth available.
  Increasing this value may improve the time it takes to complete an
  S3 transfer.


max_queue_size
--------------

**Default** - ``1000``

The AWS CLI internally uses a producer consumer model, where we queue up S3
tasks that are then executed by consumers, which in this case utilize a bound
thread pool, controlled by ``max_concurrent_requests``.  A task generally maps
to a single S3 operation.  For example, as task could be a ``PutObjectTask``,
or a ``GetObjectTask``, or an ``UploadPartTask``.  The enqueuing rate can be
much faster than the rate at which consumers are executing tasks.  To avoid
unbounded growth, the task queue size is capped to a specific size.  This
configuration value changes the value of that maximum number.

You generally will not need to change this value.  This value also corresponds
to the number of tasks we are aware of that need to be executed.  This means
that by default we can only see 1000 tasks ahead.  Until the S3 command knows
the total number of tasks executed, the progress line will show a total of
``...``.  Increasing this value means that we will be able to more quickly know
the total number of tasks needed, assuming that the enqueuing rate is quicker
than the rate of task consumption.  The tradeoff is that a larger max queue
size will require more memory.


multipart_threshold
-------------------

**Default** - ``8MB``

When uploading, downloading, or copying a file, the S3 commands
will switch to multipart operations if the file reaches a given
size threshold.  The ``multipart_threshold`` controls this value.
You can specify this value in one of two ways:

* The file size in bytes.  For example, ``1048576``.
* The file size with a size suffix.  You can use ``KB``, ``MB``, ``GB``,
  ``TB``.  For example: ``10MB``, ``1GB``.  Note that S3 imposes
  constraints on valid values that can be used for multipart
  operations.


multipart_chunksize
-------------------

**Default** - ``8MB``

**Minimum For Uploads** - ``5MB``

Once the S3 commands have decided to use multipart operations, the
file is divided into chunks.  This configuration option specifies what
the chunk size (also referred to as the part size) should be.  This
value can specified using the same semantics as ``multipart_threshold``,
that is either as the number of bytes as an integer, or using a size
suffix.
