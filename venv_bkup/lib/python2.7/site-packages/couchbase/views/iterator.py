    This class contains the handling and conversion functions between
    multiple rows and the means by which they are returned from the
    view iterator.

    This class should be overidden if you are:

    * Using a custom row class
        This saves on processing time and memory by converting from the raw
        results rather than having to unpack from the default class. This
        class returns a :class:`ViewRow` object by default. (This can also
        be overridden using the :attr:`rowclass` attribute)

    * Fetching multiple documents for each row
        You can use the :meth:`~couchbase.bucket.Bucket.get_multi`
        method to efficiently fetch multiple docs beforehand for the entire
        page.

    .. attribute:: rowclass

        Class or function to call for each result (row) received. This
        is called as ``rowclass(key, value, docid, doc)``

        * ``key`` is the key as returned by the first argument to the
            view function's ``emit``.
        * ``value`` is the value returned as the second argument to the
            view function's ``emit``, or the value of the ``reduce``
            function
        * ``docid`` is the ID of the document itself (as stored by one
            of the :meth:`~couchbase.bucket.Bucket.upsert` family of
            methods).
            If ``reduce`` was set to true for the view, this will always
            be None.
        * ``doc`` is the document itself - Only valid if ``include_docs``
            is set to true - in which case a
            :class:`~couchbase.connection.Result` object is passed.
            If ``reduce`` was set to true for the view, this will always
            be None
            Otherwise, ``None`` is passed instead.

        By default, the :class:`ViewRow` is used.
