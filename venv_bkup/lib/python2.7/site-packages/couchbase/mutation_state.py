class MutationState(object):
    """
    .. warning::

        The API and implementation of this class are subject to change.

    This class acts as a container for one or more mutations. It may
    then be used with the :meth:`~.N1QLQuery.consistent_with` method to
    indicate that a given query should be bounded by the contained
    mutations.

    Using `consistent_with` is similar to setting
    :attr:`~.N1QLQuery.consistency` to :data:`REQUEST_PLUS`,
    but is more optimal as the query will use cached data, *except*
    when the given mutation(s) are concerned. This option is useful
    for use patterns when an application has just performed a mutation,
    and wishes to perform a query in which the newly-performed mutation
    should reflect on the query results.

    .. note::

        This feature requires Couchbase Server 4.5 or greater,
        and also requires that `fetch_mutation_tokens=true`
        be specified in the connection string when creating
        a :class:`~couchbase.bucket.Bucket`
