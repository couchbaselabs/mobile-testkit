*** Test Cases ***
Test Attachment Revpos When Ancestor Unavailable
    [Documentation]    Creates a document with an attachment, then updates that document so that
    ...              the body of the revision that originally pushed the document is no
    ...              longer available.  Add a new revision that's not a child of the
    ...              active revision, and validate that it's uploaded successfully.
    ...              Example:
    ...                 1. Document is created with attachment at rev-1
    ...                 2. Document is updated (strip digests and length, only put revpos & stub) multiple times on the server, goes to rev-4
    ...                 3. Client attempts to add a new (conflicting) revision 2, with parent rev-1.
    ...                 4. If the body of rev-1 is no longer available on the server (temporary backup of revision has expired, and is no longer stored
    ...                   in the in-memory rev cache), we were throwing an error to client
    ...                   because we couldn't verify based on the _attachments property in rev-1.
    ...                 5. In this scenario, before returning error, we are now checking if the active revision has a common ancestor with the incoming revision.
    ...                  If so, we can validate any revpos values equal to or earlier than the common ancestor against the active revision.
