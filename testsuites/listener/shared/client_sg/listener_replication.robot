    [Tags]  sanity  listener  syncgateway  replication
    [Documentation]
    ...  Regression test for couchbase/couchbase-lite-java-core#1386
    ...  1. Setup SGW with a remote database name db for an example
    ...  2. Create a local database such as ls_db
    ...  3. Send POST /_replicate with source = ls_db, target = http://localhost:4985/db, continuous = true
    ...  4. Send POST /_replicate with source = ls_db, target = http://localhost:4985/db, continuous = true, doc_ids=["doc1", "doc2"]
    ...  5. Send POST /_replicate with source = ls_db, target = http://localhost:498\5/db, continuous = true, filter="filter1"
    ...  6. Make sure that the session_id from each POST /_replicate are different.
    ...  7. Send GET /_active_tasks to make sure that there are 3 tasks created.
    ...  8. Send 3 POST /_replicate withe the same parameter as Step 3=5 plus cancel=true to stop those replicators
    ...  9. Repeat Step 3 - 8 with source = and target = db for testing the pull replicator.

Replication with Session Cookie

    ...  1. SyncGateway Config with guest disabled = true and One user added (e.g. user1 / 1234)
    ...  2. Create a new session on SGW for the user1 by using POST /_session.
    ...     Capture the SyncGatewaySession cookie from the set-cookie in the response header.
    ...  3. Start continuous push and pull replicator on the LiteServ with SyncGatewaySession cookie.
    ...     Make sure that both replicators start correctly
    ...  4. Delete the session from SGW by sending DELETE /_sessions/ to SGW
    ...  5. Cancel both push and pull replicator on the LiteServ
